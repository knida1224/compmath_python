'''Consider the following sequence of strings S0,S1,S2,...: S0 = "x", S1= "y", and 
Sn= Sn-1||Sn-2 for n>1, where || denotes concatenation. For instance S2="yx", S3="yxy".
Write a function fib_string(n), which for a given natural number n returns the string Sn.'''

should return 2. Hint: You can use the abs() function to compute the absolute value of 
a number.'''

Write a function game(), which enables a user to play the following game against the 
computerâ€”the computer must always win if it has the first move:  The game starts with 
a pile of 39 coins being on the table. Now the first player may remove 1, 2 or 3 coins. 
Then the second player may remove 1, 2 or 3 coins, then the first Player may remove 1, 2 
or 3 coins etc. The player taking the last coin wins'''
